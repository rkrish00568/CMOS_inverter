# MOS Characteristics Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This section covers the characteristics of MOS transistors, including **Id-Vg** and **Id-Vd** curves, extracted from simulations.

## 2. Id-Vg Characteristics
- Description of the transfer characteristics.
- Include a plot showing the relationship between gate voltage (Vg) and drain current (Id).
